## 🛡️ Security Operations & Defensive Analysis

I focus security operations and defensive analysis across endpoint, identity, network, and cloud environments, with an emphasis on alert triage and risk analysis.

---

### Areas of Focus
- Triage and deep investigation of security alerts across endpoint, identity, and cloud logs
- Correlating telemetry to understand scope, intent, and real impact
- Finding misconfigurations and reducing attack surface (especially in Azure)
- Writing clear, defensible notes that explain why something was escalated or closed


### Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Sentinel (KQL)  
- Splunk Enterprise Security, SPL  
- Endpoint & network telemetry (EDR/XDR, Sysmon, NIDS)  
- Authentication & access logs, phishing analysis, OSINT  
- Azure Security (identity, logging, resource exposure analysis)
