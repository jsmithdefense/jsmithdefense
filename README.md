## Security Operations & Threat Investigation

I focus on security operations, threat investigation, and exposure reduction across endpoint, identity, network, and cloud environments. My work emphasizes hypothesis-driven analysis, evidence-based decision making, and separating security risk from background noise.

This GitHub centralizes hands-on projects, investigation walkthroughs, and security research to demonstrate how I reaon through SOC operations.
