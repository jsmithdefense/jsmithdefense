## 🛡️ Security Operations & Defensive Analysis

I focus on security operations, defensive analysis, and exposure reduction across endpoint, identity, network, and cloud environments. My work emphasizes hypothesis-driven analysis, evidence-based decision making, and separating actionable security risk from background noise.

This GitHub centralizes hands-on projects, investigation walkthroughs, and practical security analysis to demonstrate how I reason through SOC operations.
