### Highlighted Projects

- [**Cloud Storage and Credential Exposure Risk** - Azure](https://github.com/jsmithdefense/Security-Projects/blob/main/Detection-and-Alerting/Azure-Credential-Exposure.md)

  > _Used a Microsoft CTI report to reason about how implicit trust of keys or SAS tokens enables a path to silent persistence in Azure. Once enumerated, access is granted without re-evaluating identity. I built a KQL detection to flag identities enumarating their credentials outside of their normal pattern, where that risk is highest._
  
- [**Spear-Phishing & Lateral Movememnt Investigation** - Splunk](https://github.com/jsmithdefense/Security-Projects/blob/main/Threat-Investigation/Splunk-Phishing-Lateral-Movement.md)

  > _Investigated a spear-phishing campaign attributed to Taaedonggang APT. Correlated email, endpoint, and network telemetry to trace the attack from a malicious invoice attachment through PowerShell AMSI evasion, C2 beaconing, and lateral movement across four hosts. Estimated roughly 120MB of outbound data exfiltrated across the environment._
