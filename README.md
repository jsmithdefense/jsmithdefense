## 🛡️ Security Operations & Defensive Analysis

I focus security operations and defensive analysis across endpoint, identity, network, and cloud environments, with an emphasis on alert triage and risk analysis.

---

### Areas of Focus
- Triage and deep investigation of security alerts across endpoint, identity, and cloud logs
- Correlating telemetry to understand attacker behavior, intent, and potential impact
- Reasoning about ways to mitigate risk without negatively impacting buisness or end user operations
